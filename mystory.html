  Hi, my name is Laura Maushard and it has always been my passion to create
  jewelry for family and friends. Now I want to expand beyond the local area
  and reach people from all around the world. I am a wife and mom of one child
  and work full time at the local hospital. One day I would like to take that
  leap and create jewelry pieces full time. I truly enjoy making others happy
  and one way of doing that is by creating jewelry that shows their inner
  beauty. Thank you for stopping by to check out just a few of my pieces I have
  available. I create my own pieces but I also build to order as well.
